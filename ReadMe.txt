If you would rather create from scratch, paste "Raw VBA" into a new spreadsheet. Your spreadsheet should have target Zlayers listed in Column A (starting on row 2) and have the same decimal precision as what is found in your gCode.  Column B should have the corresponding extruder temp. The code runs through the gCode looking for instances of matching Z layers, and inserts a new line adding the target extruder temp.
